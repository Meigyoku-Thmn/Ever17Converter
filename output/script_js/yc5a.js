   Kid`"So both twins have the exact same genetic makeup - that's why they're called identical, because they look the same, and of course they're the same gender."`;
   Kid`"So, for identical twins, you can't have anything other than two girls or two boys."`;
   Kid`"But, di-zygotic on the other hand...is when two different eggs are fertilized by different sperm."`;

   Kid`"They may not even look much alike."`;

   You(C5A023)`"If only I could hack into there..."`;
   You(C5A024)`"Then I could find out details, get the whole story..."`;
   `The 'there' she was pointing at was LeMMIH's 'High Security Data.' `;
