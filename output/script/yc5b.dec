{marker}{appendText}Puzzled and confused, my head felt like it 
was about to explode.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I didn't know things that I was supposed to 
know...I knew things that I wasn't supposed 
to....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}(That must be why my head is so confused.){waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}(I still haven't recalled any of my memories.){waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Some parts of it had come back, but nothing 
really important.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}To begin with, I still didn't know what kind 
of person this 'Hokuto' was.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And at the same time, I knew what I wasn't 
supposed to know and I could see what I 
wasn't supposed to see. {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}For instance, the world 17 years into the 
past. {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}About the legend of Pygmalion, the Tief Blau 
Virus, the Cure Virus, Pipi, and Chami....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I knew about all of them now.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I knew exactly what had happened during the 
dramatic escape 17 years ago, and what had 
happened on May 6th and 7th.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And the world in 2034.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I could sense even the different history 
flows in this world.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I knew about escaping using the principle of a 
siphon and about swimming to the ocean 
surface from 104 feet under the water.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}The third eye...Blick Winkel...those words 
were clear in my head.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And...then....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I remembered running into Ms. Tanaka on the 
floating island.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Or maybe more precisely I should say 'I could 
see it' rather than 'remember it'.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Anyway, I saw her.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}The woman who was called Ms. 
Tanaka...Yubiseiakikana's mother....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Meaning, she was actually Yubiseiharukana.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Although their relationship defied the norm, 
still Yubiseiharukana and Yubiseiakikana 
were mother and daughter.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}.................{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Pieces of my thoughts scattered....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I tried gathering them and struggled to come 
up with some kind of conclusion.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"It's 2034 now...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"And Coco was in 2017...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I whispered to confirm the facts.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yes, that's right, it was 2034 now....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}That was why Tsugumi had been so suspicious 
of us.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Because the same thing that had happened 17 
years ago was repeating....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}How about the others?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Since Yubiseiakikana had been one 17 years 
ago, she couldn't possibly have known about 
the incident.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And since Sara hadn't been born yet, she 
wouldn't know either.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Sora, being AI, couldn't lie. And she didn't 
seem to be lying either.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}So that only left Kaburaki.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Did that mean Kaburaki was the mastermind 
behind this whole incident in 2034?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}No, wait....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}There had been two others who had survived the 
incident 17 years ago....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yubiseiharukana and Coco.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}On May 6, 2017.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Kaburaki, Yubiseiharukana, and Coco who had 
been infected with the Tief Blau Virus, had 
been rescued by the mini-sub, which came to 
the pool in IBF.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Oh, wait...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}How did the three of them recover from the 
virus after they'd been infected?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Because of the injection of antibodies made 
from Tsugumi's blood...?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But Coco hadn't received the antibodies.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Because she had been under high-pressure 
oxygen treatment in the capsule pod at the 
time....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Huh...?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}(No, no, even before that){waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}(Yubiseiharukana suffered from 'critical 
heart disease,' right?){waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}(But Yubiseiharukana is still alive and well 
now){waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"What is going on here...?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}(Well I guess there's just one answer....){waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}(It's the only explanation...){waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yubiseiharukana and Kaburaki must have been 
infected with the Cure Virus.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Their bodies must had repeated five years 
worth of cell division, and when all their 
DNA had been replaced, they stopped aging.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}That must have been why they looked younger 
than their real age.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And Yubiseiharukana's heart disease would 
have been fixed by the Cure Virus. {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"But still...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Is that really what happened...?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In a different history flow, Kaburaki 
couldn't see the image in the pendant.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}If he wasn't lying or acting, he must not have 
possessed infrared vision.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And although I didn't have proof my instincts 
told me Yubiseiharukana didn't possess 
infrared vision, either.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Then again in the world of 2017....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Tsugumi had mentioned she was 'special' among 
carriers of the Cure Virus.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Perhaps she was a rare example of DNA 
replacement that had taken place safely over 
the whole body.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}That meant...?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yubiseiharukana and Kaburaki were not 
complete Cure, then?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But...it didn't seem to me that there could 
be any such thing as an 'incomplete Cure'..... {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Um...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"It's no use...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"I can't figure it out...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But I still had far serious matter to deal 
with.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I needed to think about this problem first.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}The problem was....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'How was I able to sense incidents that had 
taken place before I was born, or in separate 
time continua?'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'Why is the same accident as 17 years earlier 
taking place again?'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It couldn't have been a coincidence. {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Obviously someone had planned it.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}There was only one clue....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Coco.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I wanted to see Coco.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I felt that Coco would know everything there 
was to know about this incident.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But how could I find Coco who seemed to just 
pop up randomly.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Oh, I know...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I had a sudden inspiration....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I had a hunch.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}At this hour on the 5th....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Coco would show up....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In the Cosmic Whale Room....{waitForClick}{clearText}
