and even doubts as to whether my existence 
would fade away.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In the midst of my chaos, it was her innocent 
smile that helped thaw my frozen heart.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I fell for her right away.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}All I had to do was see her smile, that's all 
it took, and my fear disappeared, blown away 
like leaves falling off a tree in autumn.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Although I was still uncertain about who I 
was, her uniqueness helped me turn my eyes

her.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I was an empty shell at that time.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Flowing into that void was her simple, pure 
smile, innocence and her total lack of 
artifice.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}From that point on - for six days - she was in my 
thoughts constantly. I found myself looking 
at her all the time.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I didn't have the courage to tell her. But it 
was enough for me just to see her.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}That's how fond I was of her.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I loved her.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Coco Yagami...{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}..................................{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And then May 6th, the fateful day arrived.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I had come down with TB, and when the rescue 
team found me, I had lost consciousness.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}By the time I found out that Coco had been 
left behind in the research facility, a few 
days had already passed.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}When You (Yubiseiharukana) told me what had 
happened, I was shocked.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And at the same time I thought 'I've got to 
go save her!' I didn't even wait for You to 
finish the rest of her story, I just ran 
outside.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}You caught up with me, and started telling me 
about things about the third eye, the fourth 
dimension, the past and future, but none of 
it made sense.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}"17 years from now, you have to go back to 
LeMU. You'll return as Takeshi Kuranari."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}"Unless we can trick Blick Winkel, wake him 
up and bring him to our world, we'll never 
save Coco and Takeshi."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'So please...help me?' —that was what You 
asked of me.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It took a few more months for me to become 
fully convinced.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}............{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}All I wanted to do was save Coco.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}If she'd be alright, I didn't mind the danger.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Even if I was despised, blamed, criticized, 
even ridiculed, none of that mattered to me.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I...just wanted...to see...Coco's smile 
again...{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Still, there was Takeshi to consider as well.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I respected him greatly.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'He was brave enough to sacrifice his life to 
save the woman that he loved.'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}For a 15-year-old like me, Takeshi was a role 
model.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I swore that I would save Coco and Takeshi, 
no matter what it took.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}..................................{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}17 years later—{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}For 17 years, You and I had spent every 
minute, every second putting our plan in 
motion.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yes...I had lived for this day.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Just six days....Coco and I had only spent 
six days together. {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But in those 17 years, not a moment went by 
that I didn't think about her.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}"Because I love her—"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}That was the only reason I had been able to 
fool everyone.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound CEP150}{appendText}[Coco]
"Heeey, Kiddo, Kiddo, Kiddo."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}My heart leaped.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}She was calling to me...{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I couldn't turn around.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I stood there frozen, even forgetting to 
breathe.{waitForClick}{clearText}
