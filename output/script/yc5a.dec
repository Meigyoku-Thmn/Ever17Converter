"So?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Mono-zygotic is when one egg is fertilized, 
and then that embryo splits into two."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"So both twins have the exact same genetic 
makeup - that's why they're called identical, 
because they look the same, and of course 
they're the same gender."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"So, for identical twins, you can't have 
anything other than two girls or two boys."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"But, di-zygotic on the other hand...is when 
two different eggs are fertilized by 
different sperm."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"So, they're two separate entities from the 
beginning - each with a different genetic 
makeup. That way they may or may not be the 
same gender."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"They may not even look much alike."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"They're basically just like other siblings."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]

"Yoichi Tanaka passed away 17 years ago."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A018}{appendText}[Sora]
"Yukie Tanaka passed away 15 years ago as 
well."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yoichi was You's father, and Yukie was her 
mother.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Both of You's parents had passed away.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It was unfortunately a fact that was true.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}There was proof, including dated mail and 
other files.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I had seen them with my own eyes.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But You still wasn't convinced.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In her heart she still believed that her 
father was alive.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Of course, regarding her mother, she was even 
more vehement.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A019}{appendText}[You]
"But my mother works at LeMU."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A020}{appendText}[You]
"We were living together until right before

"There's no way she died 15 years ago..."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It was hard to know what to say...but...I 
said this - {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Maybe she wasn't your real mother."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Meaning she might not even be Yukie..."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}You was shaking her head back and forth as if

"Aahhh....."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A023}{appendText}[You]
"If only I could hack into there..."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A024}{appendText}[You]
"Then I could find out details, get the whole 
story..."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}The 'there' she was pointing at was LeMMIH's 
'High Security Data.' {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}All afternoon and into the night, she had 
tried to hack her way in, but kept getting 
rejected at the confirmation point.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}She knew the password.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}"The empty fall sky...A single cuckoo calls 
out...Brings a chill to me."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}She kept trying different variations: caps, 
lowercase, different fonts, Latin, German...{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}She enlisted Sora and Sara's help, and they 
tried every possibility they could think 
of...but all to no avail.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}LeMMIH had built a high, impenetrable castle, 
and You was turned back again and again right 
at the gates.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}She was stricken with frustration and grief...{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Finally, exhausted and at a loss, she found 
her way over to the Lemurian Ruins.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}..................{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}By the time I spotted her, she had climbed 
all the way to the top.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I sat down beside her. Neither of us spoke.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But from time to time, You would let out a 
sigh like she had thought of something.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Time passed slowly...{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A025}{appendText}[You]
"Listen, Kid, you get premonitions, right?"  {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}After about the 153rd sigh, You suddenly came

"Can you see anything about my parents?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"Well, you know ...premonitions...aren't the 
same as seeing into the past..."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"And you're talking about 15 and 17 years 
ago..."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[Kid]
"When I was only one, or not even born yet.  
Either way, there's no way I can look that 
far into the past."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A027}{appendText}[You]
"You are totally useless...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{sound C5A028}{appendText}[You]

{marker}{appendText}Actually, there is one more distinguishing 
characteristic of the Cure species.{waitForClick}
{appendText}Which is 'Infrared vision.'{waitForClick}
{appendText}Because in its production it lost the

ultraviolet rays.{waitForClick}
