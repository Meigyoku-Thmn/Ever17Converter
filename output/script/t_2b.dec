"Whew. That should do it."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I wiped my sweat away with my collar.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It was just like Tsugumi had said. The 
blackout was caused when the safety valve had 
opened due to the drop in air pressure.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'When pressure from the steam becomes 
excessive, the valve automatically opens to 
release the gas and prevent damage.'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'Normally after a release of surplus gas, the 
valve is designed to shut automatically...but 
we're at 1 atmosphere, so...'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'Because the safety valve never closed, the
