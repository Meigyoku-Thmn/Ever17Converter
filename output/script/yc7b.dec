{marker}{appendText}But how did it happen...?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I supposed Yubiseiharukana had kept her

rescued immediately afterwards.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In this version of history, Takeshi hadn't 
died 17 years ago, but was still alive and 
well.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}So in this world, Tsugumi didn't have to send 
Hokuto and Sara to the institution.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In this version of the future, Hokuto and 
Sara didn't have to be separated.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Besides....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I understood that the incident in 2034 was 
planned so that I, Blick Winkel would come 
into existence.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It was planned to have me descend in this

that Coco and Takeshi would be saved. {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But...in this history, Coco and Takeshi had

world.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}So, Yubiseiharukana didn't have to come up 
with an outrageous plan to 'trap everyone at 
LeMU.'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Which meant that the incident, starting on

history.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}None of them had been trapped in LeMU.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Which meant that Yubiseiharukana had no 
reason to lie to Yubiseiakikana.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yubiseiharukana must have told

{marker}{appendText}Hey, but wait a second....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I needed to think a little more about this.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In 2017, Takeshi and Coco were saved by 
Yubiseiharukana's action.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}So if the time passed by peacefully, 
eventually it would be the year 2034.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}There wouldn't be any accident.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}I, Blick Winkel, wouldn't appear.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}What would happen then?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Hokuto in this world wouldn't talk to Takeshi 
in the past (which is 2017).{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In the past that I know....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Hokuto had funneled his raw, untamed 'force', 
and had shouted to Takeshi's body lying on 
the bottom of the ocean.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}'Dad! Daad! Don't you die on me!'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But in the past retraced from this future, 
Takeshi had never heard his son's scream.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}That meant....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Takeshi would have long decomposed on the 
bottom of the ocean....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Since Takeshi hadn't come back to life, Coco 
would have been left in the hallway, and....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Both of them would die.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Because the incident in 2017 had already 
taken place as a historical fact.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Which meant that even in the past connected 
directly to this world, the incident in 2017 
wouldn't have been avoided.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Therefore this world could never be possible.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It could never exist! It was a paradox!{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}If this world could exist, this question would

today?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Was it Hokuto from a different future...?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Was it that Hokuto from a world where there 
had been an accident in 2034...who had saved 
Takeshi...?{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}No...that was not possible....{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Because in order for the incident to take 
place in 2034.... {waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}The condition must be that 'Takeshi could not 
be saved in 2017.'{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Which meant:{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}In order for Takeshi to come back to life at 
the bottom of the ocean, the events had to 
take place in 2034.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}And in order for Coco to go under cryogenic

2034!{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Therefore, this peaceful world could never

"But in order for me to reappear, you will 
need to trick me. "{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"So what I am asking you to do is, trick me 
17 years from now!"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Trick me into falsely believing that it is 
the year 2017 again."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"When that happens, I will still be the third

reveal myself."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"And unless I reveal myself, neither Takeshi 
nor Coco will be saved."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Because in order to restore life to Takeshi, 
who sank to the bottom of the ocean, I will 
need to appear as myself and go back to the

"If I do not appear myself, Takeshi is going

"If you save Takeshi and Coco now, the events

"If I do not appear, then I will be unable to

"In order for me to appear in the year 2034, 
you MUST NOT rescue Takeshi and Coco now."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"I know it is painful, but that is the only

"..........................."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"And...as for the way to trick me...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Well, how can I explain...? You will need a

"Although it should not be too difficult."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"You certainly have enough time...17 years,

"First, Sara will be visiting LeMU for a 
school event on that day."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Sara is Tsugumi's daughter who will be born 
next January."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"She is actually a twin, and her twin 
brother's name is Hokuto...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"But due to unavoidable circumstances, 
Tsugumi, Sara and Hokuto will be separated."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"So you could probably just tell Tsugumi 'you 
will be reunited with your son and daughter 
at LeMU.'"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"If you tell her that, Tsugumi will come to 
LeMU for sure...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Next, you can also invite Hokuto in the same 
way."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"If you tell him 'you will meet your mother 
and sister', he will also come, alone."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"You must also have your daughter, 
Yubiseiakikana, work as LeMU attendant just 
as you did."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"If you coach her, you could lead her in that 
direction, right?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"And you must not tell anything to Sora."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"It is best that you erase her memories of the 
incident in 2017."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"There is nothing to worry about because all 
the backup memories are saved in the terabyte 
disc."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"And finally...you will need the cooperation 
of young Kaburaki."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"17 years from now, Kaburaki must look and act 
absolutely like Takeshi Kuranari."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"So he must begin training to look and act 
just like Takeshi."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Do not worry. He will catch on in 17 years."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"These six people are required for the plan."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"All you have to do is...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Simply throw them all together into LeMU on 
May 1, 2034, and have an accident similar to 
the one in 2017."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"If you can arrange this, things will work 
out by themselves."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"The time in question will be one week from 
the 1st to the 7th."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"For these seven days, you must not interfere

"No matter what kind of crisis happens. 
Understood?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"They will survive by themselves."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"And...should I show no sign of reappearing 
by 9 p.m. on the 6th...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Then I ask of you to rescue them all...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Is that clear? Will you do what I just told 
you? You must not forget."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"On May 1, 2034, you are going to trick me. 
Understood?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"Oh...wait...I mean not 'me' to be

"I want you to trick Hokuto."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"You must trick him so that he will believe 
it is the year 2017."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"..........................."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"17 years from now, without remembering why, 
I might ask you something like..."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]

"'I only followed your directions.'"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"...That is all."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"It was kind of lengthy, but...do you 
understand? You got it, right?"{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}[BW]
"I need you to understand this...."{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Yubiseiharukana was surprisingly accepting.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}As if overwhelmed by my enthusiasm, she kept 
nodding her head.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}But I was still worried...about whether she 
truly understood everything.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Explaining to her again in more detail, I 
repeated the same words almost as if I were 
trying to hypnotize her.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}It took several more hours for her to 
precisely capture the whole picture.{waitForClick}{clearText}{marker}{appendText}Hokuto and I made sure that she understood 
one last time. Then we left her.{waitForClick}{clearText}
