The goal of this project is to find a way to "convert" the Ever17 Visual Novel into RenPy engine, along with its' script functionality. Based on the VNDS implementation from https://weeaboo.nl/

Basically, I try to convert __everything__, even the tiniest visual effect.
- Almost all significant opcodes are resolved;
- Can extract everything.

This is somewhat a "scratch" project, so don't expect it tidy. I will make a new repo and delete this one once I finish this.
