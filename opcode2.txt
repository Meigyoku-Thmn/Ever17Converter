waitForClick: wait until user clicks or presses accept button

clearText: clear all text in avl mode, not sure about nvl mode
   - used in every normal dialogue to clear previous dialogue text
   - this game use clearText even in selection menu (for branching), you should remove it in such situation so the reader can still see the previous dialogue text in selection menu
   - you can ignore it if you find it in nvl mode

delay(n): wait in n second(s)
   - hard to skip by mouse click or button press, except for fast forward

appendText: appear before any text
   - can be ignore

choice: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
   - cond: hide/show choice base on condition

waitForSound: wait until current sound ends (only for sound triggered by stropcode)
   - hard to skip by mouse click or button press, except for fast forward

sound: play a sound by filename

marker: not sure what for
   - can be use as a marker to recognize the beginning of a dialogue text, except for some special situation (require manual interpretation)

nextPage: seems to be used to clear text in nvl mode
   - {nextPage 04} seems to be the only one that actually clears text, the others don't trigger any visual effect, I believe you can ignore the others.

bigChar: enlarge the character after this, has noticeable usage in Sara bad ending
